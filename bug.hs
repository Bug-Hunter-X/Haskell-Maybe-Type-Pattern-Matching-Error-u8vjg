This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on a Maybe type, but fails to handle the `Nothing` case, leading to a runtime exception.

```haskell
-- Incorrect handling of Maybe
getName :: Maybe String -> String
getName (Just name) = name

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let name = getName Nothing  -- This will cause a runtime error
  putStrLn name
```
